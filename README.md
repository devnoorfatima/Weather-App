# Weather-App
It is a weather app made to practice API fetching.

### What I used:

- JSON fetch method
- Javascript Fetch method
- JQuery
- Unsplash images for various backgrounds
- Google Fonts
- Font Awesome
- Data fetching by Api:
- Through fetch method
- Through getJSON method

### How it works:

- It automatically detects your location.
- Give the temperature
- Shows the state of climate
- Tells temperature in Farenheit and Celcius
